  <h2>The Fairytale Story</h2>

  <p>
    <i>Once upon a time</i>, in a meadow where daisies danced and the breeze sang lullabies, lived 
    <strong>Princess Bella</strong>—a bunny with a crown of wildflowers and a giggle that made tulips bloom. 
    Her best friends were <strong>Hugo the Hedgehog</strong>, who loved riddles and rolling down hills, and 
    <strong>Olive the Owl</strong>, who collected shiny treasures and knew every secret path in the forest.
  </p>

  <p>
    One morning, Bella twirled in the grass and said, “Let’s go on an adventure!”  
    “To the Whispering Wind Cave!” Olive hooted. “It’s said to echo your wishes!”  
    Hugo rolled ahead, laughing, “I wish for a riddle no one can solve!”
  </p>

  <p>
    They followed glowing mushrooms, tiptoed across vine bridges, and played tag with chipmunks until they reached the cave. 
    Inside, the walls shimmered with silver leaves, and the wind swirled gently, whispering back their wishes.
  </p>

  <p>
    Bella wished for a garden that bloomed all year.  
    Hugo wished for endless riddles.  
    Olive wished for a feather that could write stories in the sky.  
    The cave sparkled, and the wind carried their dreams into the stars.
  </p>

  <p>
    As the sun dipped low, the friends skipped home, sleepy but smiling.  
    “That was the best adventure ever,” said Hugo.  
    “And tomorrow,” Bella whispered, “we’ll chase the clouds.”
  </p>

  <p><i>The End.</i></p>
